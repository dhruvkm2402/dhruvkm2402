### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub Repository!

Greetings! I'm Dhruv Mehta, a passionate Ph.D. candidate at the prestigious Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research in the vibrant city of Greenville, SC. I'm delighted to share my journey in the exciting realm of autonomous systems and the cutting-edge research I'm conducting here.

### About My Research:
My primary focus is motion planning and control of actively articulated wheeled systems, particularly wheeled-leg configurations. In my research, I seek to push the boundaries of autonomy by integrating model-based and reinforcement learning techniques. By blending these methodologies, I aim to enhance autonomous vehicles' and robots' intelligence and decision-making capabilities.

### My Interests:
I am deeply fascinated by the development of an end-to-end sim2real pipeline. Such a pipeline could revolutionize the deployment of autonomous vehicles and robots by bridging the gap between simulated environments and real-world challenges. My goal is to contribute to the advancement of this technology and create a positive impact on society.

### Collaboration and Contributions:
Collaboration is the cornerstone of innovation, and I firmly believe in the power of teamwork. I am always open to collaborating with like-minded individuals and teams to tackle challenging problems with autonomy. Together, we can pool our expertise and create novel solutions that shape the future of autonomous systems.

This GitHub repository is a platform to showcase my research work, projects, and contributions to the community. Feel free to explore the projects, provide feedback, and even propose collaborations. I look forward to connecting with fellow enthusiasts, researchers, and developers who share a passion for autonomy and its transformative potential.

Let's collaborate to drive autonomous technology forward and build a safer, more competent, and more efficient world. Thank you for visiting my repository, and I'm excited to embark on this journey of exploration and innovation with you!
